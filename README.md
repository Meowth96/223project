# 223project
Overview
Create a masterpiece that demonstrates your understanding of java programming in the modality
of your choice. Illustrate that you understand the fundamental concepts of this discipline and can
create an original example specific to your own interests. You may work alone or in groups of up
to three (with my permission if you would like to have a group of four). Each of you must take
full responsibility for meeting all the requirements and expectations of the final project. For
students who choose to work in groups, it is absolutely imperative that each member takes an
active role and works co-operatively in completing all aspects of the project.
Process
The final project involves proposing, designing, creating, testing, debugging and documenting a
computer program that demonstrates the programming knowledge and skills that were learned
over the course of the semester. The final project will take the form of a three-step process: the
proposal, and the completed program itself, and a presentation.
Requirements
Part I – Proposal (20% of total final project, Due Nov 13, 2017)
Your proposal will outline the intended program. As stated above, you will decide upon a
program that will demonstrate the knowledge and skills that you have learned in the course. Your
proposal must be written in Microsoft Word (or any other word processing program), should be
approximately 250-300 words in length, and must include the following headings:
(i) DESCRIPTION
Describe the program you will be creating by explaining everything that your program will do,
including rules (if you’re creating a game) or instructions explaining how the program works.
(ii) DETAILS
Briefly explain some of the programming constructs (decision structures, repetition, classes, etc.)
that will be used in the program in order to make your program fully functional.
As this course covered specific technologies, they are expected as a minimum standard for your
final project. Unless otherwise cleared with me, your project should have the following elements:
Be written in the Java programming language
Incorporate some sort of advanced data structure (database, array-based, or file-based)
Incorporate some sort of user interface design (standalone or web-based)
Solve some identified problem
Work as designed without crashing
Illustrate a basic knowledge of advanced programming principles
More specifically, the following guidelines will be used to determine if your program is sufficiently
complex to qualify for full credit:
Your program must consist of at least two* group member (2* group member) classes (it will likely
have more) with some demonstration of inheritance, and aggregation.
Your program should respond to mouse events.
At least one of the classes must be a complex/custom object that consists of at least 5 graphical
components and 4 public methods in addition to its constructor.
Your program must use loops in some appropriate manner.
Your program must use Arrays or ArrayLists, nested loops in an appropriate manner.
The proposal will be graded based on the following criteria:
Knowledge and Understanding: Demonstrates an understanding of the program that will be created
and the steps that will be required to complete the program
Thinking: The proposal clearly describes and identifies programming concepts and constructs that
will be used in the program
Communication: The proposal is well-written and clearly communicates information through the
use of acceptable grammar and spelling
Application: Applies understanding of programming concepts to describe the program that will be
created and how the program requirements will be met
Part II – Program (60% of total final project, Due Dec 11, 2017)
At this stage, you will begin coding your program using Java. Your coded program must include
internal documentation that clearly indicates the purpose and function of all aspects of the program.
Your code will need to be submitted on the date it is due (hard due date Dec 11, 2017).
The proposal will be graded based on the following criteria:
Knowledge and Understanding: Demonstrates an understanding of how to write a program using
Swing components, event listeners, 1D and 2D arrays, lists, files, classes, etc.
Thinking: Validates program to ensure the program produces correct results. Develops program
logic to solve and debug all aspects of the program
Communication: Provides internal documentation that clearly explains program logic. Uses proper
naming conventions for variables, methods, etc.
Application: Effectively applies Java programming skills to create a program
Part III – Presentation (20% of total final project, Week of Dec 4, 2017)
Each team will need to present your work in front of all other teams and me for 20 min with 5 min
for questions if there are any. Everyone will get involved in grading other’s work at this stage.
Grading will be anonymous, and the average will be calculated towards the final grades. (Due the
week of Dec 4, 2017 in-class)
